### Homework Workflow


- Put your name, GitHub username and email in my spreadsheet: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kSTunUHVQzu0lHvX3zOOiySbS6wHrXiB1HMnV57zYPw/edit?usp=sharing>
    - this allows me to add you to our class roster
- Follow the link to your homework assignment
    - the links are sent via email and on the README file for each unit repository
- Accept the assignment
    - link your GitHub account to your username listed in the roster (1st assignment only)
-	Follow the link to your new, private homework repository. 
    - You may need to refresh the page to see your new repository.
    -	Once your private homework repo is created, you can access it from our classroom GitHub page <https://github.com/MSCI-758>
-	Clone the repository to your local computer 
    -	Click `Code` and copy the repo link
    -	Open RStudio and create a new project with Git version control using the repo link
-	Do the homework assignment
    -	Add your text and code to answer the questions at the bottom of the HW file (e.g. `HW_2a_sea_level_rise.Rmd`)
-	Use the `Git` pane in RStudio to push your work out to GitHub periodically 
    -	stage the files you want added to the repo (please include the .Rproj file)
    -	commit (donâ€™t forget the commit message!)
    -	pull (to check for updates already up on GitHub)
    -	push out your new files and edits to the online repo 
    -	Note: You can push out edits as often as you want - I won't look at or consider your homework "final" until after the due date.
